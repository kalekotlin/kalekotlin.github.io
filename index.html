                    <p>Come look at the source code for this website! 
                    It was made using Jekyll. While Jekyll includes 
                    website templates, I decided to try a hand at 
                    designing the site myself.</p>

                        When finished, the game will follow the player character through an average day-in-the-life-of type situation. However, the mood darkens considerably as the game comes to a climax.

                    <p>A simple browser game demo I made using
                        HTML and Javascript. The goal is to avoid
                        the red circles while trying to collide with the blue ones. 
                        The size of the player circle increases and decreases depending
                        on the circle they collide with, adding some challenge to the game.

                    <p>On numerous occasions, I had need of an excel document
                        containing testing data, such as names, emails, and phone numbers. Instead of populating the data by hand, I made this 
                        program. It is now written in plain C; however, it was originally written in Python.
