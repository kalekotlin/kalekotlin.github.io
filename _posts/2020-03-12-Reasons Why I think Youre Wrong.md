title: Reasons Why I Think You're Wrong
--- 
## A ranting essay on my feelings towards my parents' politics:  
### &nbsp;&nbsp;This will definitely be kind of a weird post, but...   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I actually don't care all that much? Mayhaps it's because I just finished my first beer, or maybe I'm just feeling especially bold. But, after a lifetime of bad-faith arguments and emotionally-charged outbursts from them, I think I deserve a bit of space to do some whining. Plus, I highly doubt my folks would read any of this. I say that for a few reasons, but the main one being I don't think I've ever seen them read a book, nor would I expect them to have the attention span to read a long essay about why their son thinks that they are generally wrong about most things. But this post isn't _really_ about my squirmy relationship with my parents.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually want to talk about their politics, their beliefs, and their overall grasp on current events. And to give a little context, my family has always been """Christian""" and """Republican"""; I put those words in multiple quotes to really drive home my next point: I never remember going to church, nor do I remember my parents ever voting. They really were only ever interested in the "idea" of Republicanism, and they would enforce those ideas on me in an inconsistent, incoherent, clumsy sort of way. Despite only getting the gist of the ideology, it seems to me that they think Republicanism is the default state of things. "Liberals" -- whatever that actually means to them -- are the ones outside of the status quo. They never really *tried their best* to instill those ideas in me, more so they just brought them up in an aggressive fashion from time to time. In particular, my father. For example, he has exhibited, multiple times, his dislike towards: the LGBT community (and very specifically gay men and trans women), immigrants and minorities (in general, but generally not hardcore or outwardly racist), and *drum roll please...* LIBERALS and LEFTISTS! These opinions seemingly come out of nowhere. And God forbid you try to debate them in any way.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this is aimed in a more personal direction, towards my family (although only God knows if they'll ever see this), I feel like there's probably a good chance that I'm not alone here. There is no way in hell that I'm the only person who thinks their father was brainwashed and poisoned by Fox News.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This next section of the post will be speaking to the series of (non-stop) text messages I received from my dad. I think these texts really encapsulate the kind of rambling garbage that my whole childhood was built on -- mistruths wrapped in misguided anger. I love my dad, but I do not love his ideas or thought processes.

If you want a peak at what others had to say about these texts, here's a [reddit thread posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/fe1u1f/im_24_all_i_said_was_im_voting_for_bernie/) on _/r/insaneparents_.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, he was not overtly happy about me voting for Bernie / Warren. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might seem somewhat crazy to break down and debate a series of uneducated text messages from a man who seemingly can barely spell or form coherent sentences. However, I've never had much of chance to directly call bullshit on each every point he has made. So here we go:  

The points my dad made, in order: 
1. Claims I should move to Russia if I disagree with him (i.e. if I side with the "communists")
2. Something about the two party system and slavery (?)
3. Anyone who has different ideas that he doesn't like are inherently wrong
4. Someone wants to take away his guns (not sure who)
5. Antifa and anti-fascism protests (they're pussy bitches)
6. Hates politics, but will endlessly rant about unintelligible and fairly dangerous political ideas. Being apolitical is in and of itself a political statement
7. Anyone younger than him is wrong
8. Wants to protect his rights, but doesn't name any and suggests he'd do it via violent means
9. He's a real American and Democrats are weak, non-Americans

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Russia, much like China, is in my opinion a totalitarian nightmare system ran by tyrants. Their systems of governance is communism by name only. Their peoples are arrested, murdered, and tortured by their own governments. Russia and China's political systems are some of the nastiest I've had the pleasure of reading about. In my honest opinion, America is only a few wrong decisions from heading down the same path. Our government has a _really bad history_ of mistreating people. I want our country to get better. And that starts with our state and federal governments actually respecting and protecting its people.  

Just because I want Americans to have an easier time getting access to treatment and education does not mean I want the USA to become a totalitarian, communist, oligarchy. I just want less children to starve, and don't want people like my mom -- your ex wife -- to drown in medical debt from her unexpected spat with cervical cancer.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. I've reread this text a few times, and can't quite discern the actual point he's trying to make here. But fuck it, let me guess: he hates """communism""", it takes both sides of the aisle to work together, slavery, and ultimately its failure, was due to a """disagreement""" over policy. What a headache.    
- Bernie Sanders is barely more than a centrist in most parts of the world. He is most definitely not a communist. The guy just wants people to live better lives. Why is access to healthcare and education seen as oppressive communism?  
- I'm down with both sides working together; but, does anyone want to guess which part of Congress is refusing to do their jobs? _Ding ding ding_, it's the GOP. If you haven't seen the stack of bills sitting on McConnell's, go ahead and look it up. And don't get me started on the judge selections.  
- The civil war was fought over slavery. Or rather, the states' right to slavery. A violent war occurred because _the other side of the aisle refused to actualize the rights of so many_. Our ancestors had to forcefully instill the idea of "freedom" in our southron brethran.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In this section, he compares himself to a brick wall. Which I find somewhat funny, since that perfectly describes him. He has always shut down others' ideas, and responded with anger. Even when I comes to benign topics, if he doesn't 100% agree, then we're 100% wrong.    
He goes onto say "don[']t push that garbage on me". Which again, is funny for obvious reasons.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. He goes on for a bit about his right to guns. I never brought up guns, nor do I know of anyone who wants to take them from him. At most, you've had people recommend tighter regulations on purchases. This point is unwarranted and odd.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Ah, yes the pussy bitches. I'm almost certain this has to be from Fox News. This point reminds me of the "_iamverybadass_" subreddit. This point and point 9 are eerily similar. In his world, conservatives are the real manly men Americans™ who are super strong, and the liberals are just pathetically weak pansy boy commie traitors. Dad, just because I'm not a big strong man-boy like you, doesn't mean _every_ leftist is like that. Not every one of us is insecure about our masculinity.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. He "hates" politics, despite so much of his live revolving around it. The company that provides him insurance, the bank that he mortgages his house from, the company he works for and the union that represents him, etc. are all deeply embedded in the political spectrum. Being apoltical, or actively avoiding politics, is inherently a political statement. It's also inherently idiotic and privileged.        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Ah yes, the "when you get older you'll be more conservative" mantra. Fuck off with that. He's happy enough with most businesses being maintained and operated by millennials and gen x'ers, he just doesn't want them to own their labor or open their dirty commie mouths.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. "Rights". What "rights" are you looking to protect? You're a middle-class, white, male property owner. If anything, dad, you're apart of a class and identity that arguably has the most rights. Also, the fact that your only solution involves violence of some sort against someone, makes me laugh. Ignorance, plain and simple.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. I'M THE TRUE SCOTSMAN! Again with the whole "you're not a _real_ American™, you're just a pussy commie bitch" shit. Progressive make progress. Not conservatives, not middle of the road corporate democrats. Why has everyone forgotten about FDR?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really could go on forever. Nearly every belief and ideal that man has spewed out over the years is built on fear and insecurities. Gaslight, obstruct, project.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really wish I could sit down and have an adult conversation with him. But, unfortunately, he's a brick wall who _just doesn't have the brains to bother_. Not to mention, I'd have to spend hours just explaining the context around the topics we'd be discussing. "Nobody knew ~~health care~~ everything could be so complicated'.
