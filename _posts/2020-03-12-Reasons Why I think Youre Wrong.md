title: Reasons Why I Think You're Wrong

## A ranting essay on my feelings towards politics, and specifically my father's politics:  
### &nbsp;&nbsp;This will definitely be kind of a weird post, but...  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I actually don't care all that much? Mayhaps it's because I just finished my first beer, or maybe I'm just feeling especially bold this evening. And, when I really think about it, I'm somewhat emotionally distant from them in many ways, and they really do find their ways to reciprocate that feeling. But this post isn't about my squirmy relationship with my parents.  

I actually want to talk about their politics, their beliefs, and their overall grasp on current events. And to give a little context, my family has always been """Christian""" and """Republican"""; I put those words in multiple quotes to really drive home my next point: I never remember going to church, nor do I remember my parents ever voting. They really were only ever interested in the "idea" of Republicanism, and they would enforce those ideas on me in an inconsistent, incoherent, clumsy sort of way. Despite only getting the gist of the ideology, it seems to me that they think Republicanism is the default state of things. "Liberals" -- whatever that actually means to them -- are the ones outside of the status quo. They never really *tried their best* to instill those ideas in me, more so they just brought them up in an aggressive fashion from time to time. In particular, my father. For example, my father has exhibited, multiple times, his dislike towards: the LGBT community (and very specifically gay men and trans women), immigrants and minorities (in general, but generally not hardcore or outwardly racist), and *drum roll please...* LIBERALS and LEFTISTS!  

While this is aimed in a more personal direction, towards my family (although only God knows if they'll ever see this), I feel like there's probably a good chance that I'm not alone here.
