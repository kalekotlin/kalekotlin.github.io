This stew is just amazing. It's sweet, it's savory, and it's filling. But best of all, it's cheap.

__Notes:__\
Sizing and quantity don't really matter in this recipe. It's a stew! I prefer more veggies and less meat, but that's me. You do you. 

I recommend 2-3 carrots for every 1 sweet potato. In my area, sweet potatoes are fairly large. As for the onions, add as much as you see fit, or none at all! 

Now, if you're not into sweet potatoes (or just don't have any on hand) any sort of potato works in a stew. However, I _highly_ recommend sweet potatoes, as they add some extra jazz to the dish. 

Pork also works as a substitute, if you want to pick up some cheap meat instead of slightly more expensive steak. 

For the oil, I recommend olive. If you're cooking with steak, then I'd throw in a little bit of butter in the last 15-30 seconds of cooking. 

Last but not least, if you don't have any thyme available, I'm sure something like rosemary or sage will work as well.

__Directions:__
1. Chop up your veggies! Sizing and quantity don't matter all that much. Though, the potatoes will shrink ever-so-slightly, so I recommend cutting them just a little bigger than you want them.

2. Chop up your meat! Again, whatever size of meat you want. Big chunks, little chunks, who cares? It's your stew! Make it as you see fit!

3. Grab a big 'ol sauce pan or whatever pot you have lying around. Crank your burner up to high-ish heat (for pork, medium-high heat works a bit better), and toss in some oil. 

4. Once the oil has heated up (you can tell it's ready when it's barely smoking / starts to have a shimmery look), toss in your cut up meat.

5. Let the meat cook for a bit before moving it around. Let some of it stick, it's fine. Don't cook the meat entirely, we just want to brown it. 

6. Now is the time to add a bit of butter if you want to! Once the butter has melted and the meat has soaked it up a bit, remove the meat from the pot.

7. Now that our pot is covered in yummy, meaty oil, let's toss in our veggies.
8. Brown the veggies up for a few minutes. They should have enough water in them to de-glaze the pot. 

9. Once the veggies have browned, toss back in the meat and stir. 

10. Open your beer and poor it in! Use this to finish the de-glazing process. Scrape the good stuff up from the bottom of the pot. 

11. Add in just enough water to cover all of your ingredients. Stir. Add in some beef broth, or better yet, Better Than Bouillon. Stir again. 

12. Add just a bit of salt, and crank the heat up to high.

13. Let this boil off for a half hour to an hour. We want our stew to reduce. If it doesn't reduce, we just get a soup. We aren't cooking soup. 

14. Once the stew has reduced most of the way, add in your thyme and pepper.

And that's it! Pull it off the heat and serve. 

Biscuits are a great addition to this dish. If you're up to, I recommend grabbing some pre-made biscuits (or make your own, depends on how you feel), and floating them on top of your stew. If you do this, don't reduce your stew quite as much. Also make sure your biscuits aren't super thick. Turn on your oven to 375 degrees and toss it in! Remove when your biscuits are baked (10-ish minutes).

Alternatively, just cook your biscuits separately. However, the dry-heat from the oven really brings this dish up a level.
