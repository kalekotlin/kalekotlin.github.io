title: The Art of Giving Up
--- 
## Wasting time every chance I get:
### &nbsp;&nbsp;How I spent years perfecting the craft of giving up and moving on.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do this thing -- and I'm sure many of you do it as well -- where I decide that I want to start a new project, and I get it all of my various ducks in a row, and I put about a day's effort into it, and I then I just kind of... give up. Unlike that run-on sentence, I tend to stop fairly early on in my thought processes. My ideas are generally half-baked, and even if they weren't, it's not like I'd ever get them to fruition. I start and stop projects like people who go on date after date with person after person. I'm interested for the first little bit, but after a small while, I usually decide that my time would be better spent elsewhere. Or I decide that I'm simply not worthy of contributing, and sulk away into the shadows. This has been going on for years at this point. I think "Hey, I want to learn this *thing*". So I try to learn the *thing*, only to find out the people who made the *thing* are way more intelligent and proficient at their craft than I could ever dream to be. So I try my best to slap together some working prototype that implements what I learned about the *thing*, but it usually turns out to be some sort of Frankenstein's monster. Except, I can't even get the monster to live. It just sits there, dead and useless, like all of my other creations.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this poor habit of barely finishing any of the projects I start, I really do want to participate and learn and grow as a developer. However, I have this eerie feeling that everything I learn is only surface-level knowledge. The good 'ol *Impostor Syndrome* butting into my life yet again. It really does make me feel like no matter how much time I sink into this, I'll never be good enough to call myself a professional programmer. This is reinforced basically any time I want to contribute to an open source project. I take a look at their code base, see all of the folders and files, cry for a bit, open their issue tracker, cry some more at all the problems I can't solve, and move onto the next project.        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't accept that maybe my brain just isn't wired in the right way to allow me to excel in this field. And if I have to accept that because I was actually correct about something for once, then I'm headed for a world of emotional anguish. I'm *not dumb*, but I'm not exceptionally smart either. I can't just cook at restaurants for the rest of my life, but I also can't just keep working at these easy-as-hell office jobs either. I don't want to cook, I don't want to clean, I don't want to test software, I don't want to monitor calls, I don't want to stare at emails all day, **I want to program**. If I can't do that, I'm going to have to spend some sincere time looking inward. Programming was what I settled on. I wasn't good enough at skateboarding for that to go anywhere, I was never an exceptional cook and I don't want to go to culinary school, I am too shy to even sing to my dog, so my dream of being a musician won't be any closer to reality any time soon; **programming** is the career that I want. But will I ever be good enough?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I work as a Software Testing Technician and Release Manager. I do a lot of things in this role, but I mostly do the following:
- Make sure that the website works as intended
- Test bug and feature tickets
- Release bug and feature tickets to our production environment
- Go to meetings   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's basically it. I wouldn't write it like that on a resume, or explain it like that in an interview; but yeah, that's really about it. I do a few more things here and there using dozens of services, working alongside dozens of people. But my God, is this job draining me of my will to live. I guess I shouldn't be that dramatic. It's a decent gig, my coworkers are great, my client is easy to work with, and my bosses are well-meaning people. But there's just something soul-crushing about repeating the same smoke test on the same website for the thousandth time.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to do more. I want to quit. It's not like I couldn't. I have a decent nest egg which could last me a half year at the very least. I could just quit and live my life for a while. I could make time for some introspection, and sharpen my skills while I'm at it. But honestly, that thought is a bit scary. I *want* to quit and spend six months working on open source projects, or do some freelancing, but I don't know if I actually *could* do that. I *could* try, but I'm scared that's really all I *could* do. At the end of the day, I'm really comfy in my current position, and I'm really scared of failing in a future position. I don't want to fail, and I don't want to risk failure. But how else do I get myself out of this pity party?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've spent years cultivating the skills needed to blow off any actual work and procrastinate my life away. Perhaps I can make that into some sort of career. Perhaps there is a job where I can spitball ideas at other people, pretend to do some work, get all of the credit for the idea despite others *doing the actual work for me*, and then go home at the end of the day with a nice paycheck in hand. But that sounds too much like being a politician, and I really don't want to lower my standards quite that far.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I should just wing it. Apply for a job, explain my current skill-level, and hope for the best. Maybe getting my foot in the door somewhere and learning how to develop professional applications alongside a well built team will finally get me to the place where I need to be. I really wish there was someone out there who'd just be willing to guide me into the development world. I wish someone was there to hold my hand. But alas, that person hasn't appeared in my life, and even if they did, they might just end up as another abandoned project of mine. Hell, I'm surprised I even finished this damned blog post.
