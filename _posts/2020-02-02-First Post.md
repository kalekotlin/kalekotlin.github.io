## Here it goes...:
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So... what do I say? I guess the idea is to just start talking about whatever. I might as well start out with a little bit of information about myself. This is a blog, so I have to write *something* down, right? Why not talk about myself?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Bryce. I live in Idaho, but I was born in Arkansas. I'm in my early to mid-twenties. I used to work in kitchens, but I graduated from being a cook into being a programmer after I spent a year or so teaching myself the trade. However, I still love cooking, especially when I get to share it with friends, family, and my fiancee. I love playing guitar and I'm pretty decent at it. I love to sing as well, though I'm not the best at that. I hate driving, I like biking, and I've only ever been on an airplane once. I was vegetarian for a number of years, for health reasons, but gave that up. Unfortunately I also gave up a bit of my exercising habits -- I should probably work on that. I love playing video games, board games, and card games. I love television and film and music. I'm a big reader, and thanks to my Kindle, I read more than ever (hit me up if you're a "A Song of Ice and Fire" fan). I spend my days as a Quality Assurance Software Testing Technician (a mouthful, I know), where I get to work with tons of equipment and write a little bit of code and do fun stuff like participate in morning stand up meetings */s*. In the future, I hope to get to the point where I can land a solid development gig somewhere. 

That... that should about cover it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I'm not much of a writer, but I thought it'd be an okay idea to toss together a blog. I haven't really written anything since the last time I had to write a high school essay (*cough* *cough* six years ago). And it gives me some more experience, which is nice because my portfolio is sincerely lacking. Sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes. I'll try my best to proof read these before posting, but I can't guarantee anything. 

I guess that's about it for this post.
