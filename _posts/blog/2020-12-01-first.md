Gotta start somewhere, right?

This is my first blog post. Not sure what to say, and not sure anyone will ever read this, but what the hell? 

First and foremost, I'm not a writer. At least, I wouldn't ever consider myself one. My grammar is generally trash. I tend to ramble a lot. I can't say that anyone would ever buy a novel of mine, if I could ever persuade myself to write one, that is. Despite all of that, I still have some inkling of motivation to write. 

In any case, I'm hoping to post something soon. Perhaps it'll be about a video game, or a book, or a movie or something. I'm not so sure yet. Maybe this will be a blog dedicated to the masterpiece that is the Golden Girls. 

Stay tuned.
