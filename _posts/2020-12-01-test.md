&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gotta start somewhere, right?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my first post. Not sure what to say, so maybe I'll make it more of an introduction. The goal of this blog is just to state what I'm thinking, as are most blogs, I guess. What I'm thinking -- I've generally accepted -- is mostly incorrect, or just trash. And how I go about expressing my thoughts is also, generally speaking, trash; I ramble and tend to lose focus of what I'm talking about. I'm not a writer. I'm not a speaker. Though, I do have a contact form if you want to bitch about it. 

As for an actual introduction of myself: I'm an introverted, pessimistic, cynical, selfish, and angry character. Not in the cool, edgy kind-of-way, mind you. Despite those traits, I'm also empathetic, loving, thoughtful, and outgoing. Sure, there's a bit of a dichotomy there, but _that's the way she goes_, I guess. 

I like reading, playing video games, playing guitar, singing, cooking, programming, chess, movies, television shows, walks in the park, and sleeping. Though, despite my array of hobbies, I somehow dislike every single one of them to some degree. It may be about time to switch things up. 

In coming posts, I'll speak to more specific topics, ranging from music, to games, to movies, to politics, to whatever. 

Thanks for reading.
